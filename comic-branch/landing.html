      <p>I don't imagine you'd come back to this after I told you it was down, and you probably observed that the link no longer worked. You finding this, in my mind, is literally up to chance. Why <i>would</i> you randomly return to this site after observing it's no longer up, right?</p>
	  <p>So, you might be wondering "why the hell have you made <i>another</i> page to replace it?" And, that's a fair question. I suppose, I just wanted to let you know that I'm not buying it. Like, you said you forgot to give it a closer look, but... I dunno, I just don't think that's true. I think you don't want to talk about it, and that's totally fair, and I even think telling me that you forgot to look at it was a really slick maneuver, and had I been less perceptive, I wouldn't have even put it together that that's not true.</p>
	  <p>And it's not your fault for me noticing either, but I will let you know how I know. So, I put a little bit of rambling about my uhm... "desires," we'll say, at the absolute end of the original "comic-branch." And the next ref you sent to #potential-refs was a ref that wasn't super far away from the scenario I had put forth, and was even a very large and motherly ref, something which I feel wouldn't have happened if you didn't read the end of my ramblings. On top of that, you also included a small little reward break for Al in our most recent roleplay, and frankly, I'm extremely appreciative of that. Like, you taking my "needs" into account is just a very nice thing to do. In the spirit of that, I'd actually like to do similar for you, by which I mean, please feel free to drop similar updates on me if you ever feel the need to. I don't mind changing up the way I play at all. I'd love to ask you directly, but it's kinda hard now, with you having claimed to not give the initial run of the website a proper viewing.</p>
	  <p>Not that I mind. In fact, I think I might still try to ask you for a similar thing regardless. And, I want to be very clear, you're not in the wrong for having lied to me. In fact, if I'm remembering correctly, I <i>asked</i> you to lie to me, specifically in the case that you didn't want to talk about it. So, I guess, thanks? It's not every day I find people on the internet that are... <i>receptive</i>, so to speak, to my sorts of wants, and I want to be very clear with just how appreciative I am. It's unfortunate, considering you might not even be reading this, but I am very thankful for you.</p>
	  <br>
	  <p>Of course, there's also the possibility that you not only <i>definitely</i> felt weirded out by the first "comic-branch," but that you really, really wanted to leave this behind, but despite that, you still checked again just to see if I would pull a weird stunt like this, and are now even <i>more</i> weirded out. In fact, the only reason you might be putting up with any of this is that our kinks just line up so well, and I don't demand roleplay or get all clingy like a <i>lot</i> of other prey on r/VoreRoleplaying. I suppose, if the stars have somehow all aligned against me, and I find myself in this worst case scenario, I'm sorry things turned out this way, but I do genuinely never plan on bringing this up to you. I will never put you in a position of having to page through a website filled with my personal feelings - it will only ever be optional and I will <i>never</i> tell you it happened. Kinda a lot like this, actually. Actually, come to think of it, I don't want you checking this url time and time again. I think I'm gonna definitively say that this is the <i>last</i> thing this page will be. I'll even leave it up like this (unless you find it and tell me to take it down, but do keep in mind that <i><b>no one</b></i> has access to this link, save for you. There's even a whole website aside from this, and there are 0 links that lead to here or any /comic-branch url, for that matter. Not that there <i>are</i> other /comic-branch urls, but the text "comic-branch" won't ever be appearing in anyone's browser, aside from yours.</p>
	  <br><br><br>
	  <p>In any case, thank you again! I cannot stress just how appreciative I am to have found someone like you online. "Friends" or not, I think you are a very cool person, and I hope I haven't significantly affected your opinion of me.</p>

      <p>Today's date is July 4th, 2023. The current time is 11:31 PM and my name is Alucard. Uh, hi Comic. You're probably wondering why I made this whole section of my website for you. Uh, don't worry, I didn't put too much effort into it, as you can tell, it's not, like, super well formatted or anything, uh... but uh, essentially I just wanted to tell you a quick thing... And then also... be exceedingly honest about that quick thing. Uh, so basically... I- This morning, I recorded this, like, 12 minute, maybe 13 minute message... uh, that essentially- I'm not going to get into the specifics, it's on the website.</p>
      <p>Uh, I've probably linked to it, in fact, on this page- And- Well, I know a link is on this page somewhere, I don't know if I have... At this point in my speech, uh, linked it though. In any case... Um... I recorded this, uh, very early in the morning, basically right after I woke up... And then I uploaded it to SoundCloud with the intent- I uploaded it <i>privately</i> with the intent.. that.. I would send it to you right before I went to a baseball game. Uh, and then I'd get home later and read your response.</p>
      <p>Uh... I... Failed. Uh, happily at that, however. Uh, I sent it.. and I didn't think.. too hard about it. And then.. later, I realized "oh my god, it's the <i>4th</i>, they're probably doing shit, and I probably shouldn't have sent that but it's a little too late to back down" and then I think it was like an hour after that, you texted me, "it says this track is private."</p>
      <p>Um, thank <i>god</i>. I don't think- nothing I said was really like, nerve-wracking or like, stressful or anything, but... I labelled it all caps "PLAY ME" on SoundCloud. Uhhh, and receiving <i>that</i> from.. somebody... that you kind of know might be worrying! And I don't want to worry you when you're with family, at least. I don't want to worry you at all, ideally, but especially not when you're with family.</p>
      <p>Um... So yeah, that's what happened. And then I covered my ass really quick. On the way home, I thought of this little bass line. Uh, it's based on a Ghost Trick track, actually. Uh, cuz that's just what I've been playing recently. And so... I... Basically bullshit improvised some other stuff, like that drum loop and that little, uh, choir... kind of thing going on. And I uploaded it <i>privately</i>, and sent you the <i>private</i> link to that. But before- before I uploaded it, I deleted the other thing. Uh, and there was a small window where that link would've told you that this track doesn't *exist*, which is the only way you could've caught me, I think. But I made sure to go invisible as soon as I came online on Discord so you wouldn't, uh... So you wouldn't know that I had gotten back and that I would maybe be doing things with that to fix it.</p>
      <p>I did. Uh, I- well, I "fixed it" in air quotes... Um, because, uh... Well, I didn't want to get caught right handed, right? I didn't want to- I-I- I- I elaborate more in the in the other audio file but I didn't... want to have that conversation essentially, I just wanted to tell you the shit, and then get your response to it, and have that be that, <i>ideally</i>. Well, maybe a conversation would happen after that but all of the... All of the- the- the shit I wanted to say at first is... You know, out there at least, right, and you can respond to whatever. Uh...</p>
      <p>Speaking of, I would like you to listen to that, following this. Uh, it's on the other page that I've linked to.</p>
      <p>Um, yeah. Not really a lot to say about that. I hope you enjoy the transcript, I worked- or the tran<i>scripts</i> plural. I worked kinda hard on them.. to make them one to one, but... You know, I'm just cool like that. Uh-huh- Anyways, uhhh, thank you for listening. Uh, also- There's... You'll see, you'll see, you'll see.</p>
	  <h2>Related, But Not Recorded</h2>
	  <p>So, first thing to note: the time between writing all this up and making sure it works took a few hours. The final build of this is only going up at, like 4 AM my time, which, relatively, is the most recent hour mark. I forget if we have time zone differences to begin with, so maybe that little explanation wasn't too helpful, at 4 AM really just was the most recent hour.</p>
	  <p>I can't believe I forgot to divulge in my awesome plan with this specific part of my website. Basically, I intended to send this link and then immediately go to sleep (as it's really late), but uh... Well, slight kink in the plan: you're still awake. Like, I'm lookin', and you've been playing Roblox for roughly 2 hours. I think what's going to end up happening here is that I'm going to take my sleep meds, wait ~30 minutes (or until drugs kick in), and then send the link and fall asleep.</p>
	  <p>As for <i>why</i> I'm going through so much effort in order to avoid talking about this immediately: I am a nervous wreck and your reaction <i>may</i> be negative. I touch on this in the other audio file a bit (because I had a very similar plan), but also, I can assure you this will not be happening in the future. There was a very specific set of circumstances that led up to me taking <i>this</i> approach, and frankly, I just want to get better at communicating, which means getting better at sharing my feelings without also hiding in a bush 8 hours away.

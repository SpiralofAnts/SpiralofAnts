      <p>Hi, Comic.</p>
	  <p>I know I said I wasn't gonna make another one of these, but... Can I just be brutally honest with you? I'm between a rock and a hard place, and I'm not sure what to do. I'm gonna let you know the minimum I can while still letting you know enough so I can get your proper judgment. Also, as a fair warning, I will not be pulling my punches, as you will soon find out.</p>
	  <p>So, first thing, I've been relapsing. Long story short, I've been having drug problems for probably about three years now, and very recently – last three months – I've been making some real headway. I've been addicted to weed since high school, and I went cold turkey for about three and a half weeks for most of July and a little bit of August. It was great! I didn't feel 100%, but who ever does? Then, on the 11th, I got myself some more and started smoking slower. I'm not packing down multiple grams a day or anything crazy like I used to, in fact, my rate of smoking is even getting <i>slower</i>, but its still something that effects our roleplays.</p>
	  <p>It used to be that I'd get progressively higher some nights while roleplaying with you, and I'm pretty sure you could tell I was on something. Then, eventually, I snuck weed into one of our roleplays with my Ollie character (the purple cat, if you don't remember), who was – more or less – a manifestation of my behavior while on weed. He's very similar to Orion, who I believe he appeared alongside with in that roleplay, as Orion used to be my old fursona when I first got addicted to weed. Now, my attitude on roleplaying while high is incredibly different: I try <i>never</i> to do it. It was sort of callous of me to do that considering my plan was to basically <i>live</i> while mildly high as long as I could, post relapse. And keep in mind, this meant, like, at work too – which I did do a few days before hastily slowing myself down again. Actually, as I write this after work, I am entirely sober. It used to be that I'd take a hit <i>immediately</i> after work on the walk home, but now, even as I sit here doing <i>nothing</i> but typing this, I don't take a hit. Hearing that, er- reading that, you might think “Well, that seems to solve his whole problem then, no? Why doesn't he – now that he's sober, by his own admittance – simply roleplay?”</p>
	  <p>Well, that brings me to my second point: quitting my other addiction. I think I have a porn addiction. I say “I think” because I'm really not sure. Since my wee teenager days (probably about 14), I haven't gone a day without jerking it at least once, unless I'm just too exhausted come bedtime. I'd <i>heard</i> of porn addictions, but I <i>never</i> accepted the idea that <i>I</i> could be addicted to porn. That is, until roughly two or so months ago, when addiction finally snapped in my mind as something that <i>purposely</i> creeps up on the victim. After I really considered whether I had a porn addiction or not, I realized how I became so hooked on vore. It is the <i>ultimate</i> act of self-pleasure, even at the cost of a person – or, hell, <i>multiple</i> people at times, especially in our roleplays. In spite of being addicted to porn, I actually think I function fine. Tons of people enjoy porn, admittedly not to the level I do, but if they can enjoy porn and be healthy about it, what's stopping me from keeping my behavior basically identical to that of a healthy person's while actually jerking off to <i>way</i> worse shit – shit people would call morally bankrupt. I've actually come to the conclusion that there's nothing stopping me from doing that, aside from my weird compulsion to roleplay with people to accomplish this. See, for some fucking reason, despite it being fictional either way, I feel the urge to involve someone else in my fantasies, ideally as the predator (big shocker). This has the effect of making it... Well, hotter for sure, but I can't actually pin down why. Maybe it feels more real to me since I've got another person going along with it now? I really don't know, but roleplaying with you is a <i>hell</i> of a lot hotter than just writing shit up in OpenOffice and keeping it to myself.</p>
	  <p>Now knowing that roleplay makes it exponentially better for me, and knowing that I don't mind my porn addiction, you might start asking that same question from earlier, but before you can this time, I'm going to move on to my next point: time crunch.</p>
	  <p>I got a job recently, like before I even realized I had a problem with weed. I actually had to take some time off for group therapy. And that's fine and well and all, and I'm actually extremely happy to be a functioning member of society, but... having a job <i>kills</i> my time, man. Like, it's <i>crazy</i> just how little time I get now. I had DND from 6 PM till whenever the hell I go to bed on Saturdays, I work Mondays and Tuesdays in addition to watching either JoJo or Dragon Ball afterwards with Mint until I go to bed, and I have an extremely “will they, won't they” plan for Friday – also after work. The only days I actually get entirely to myself <i>if</i> I choose not to hang out with my friends – some of which I don't have days scheduled for – are Sundays and Wednesdays. Pair this with my natural lean towards socially doing drugs, and my inability to roleplay with you while I'm with friends (and my resistance to roleplaying with you while I'm high) and you've got the perfect cocktail for me to not be roleplaying while also not taking steps to fix that!!</p>
	  <br><br>
	  <p>And that's all without even bothering to bring up how I've painted myself into a wall regarding our little server. This nebulous system where we can reply whenever we want to really doesn't jive well with my schedule. In fact, I've noticed that most of our roleplays tend to fall the same way: The first day or so, we're <i>bolting</i> with the messages, going back and forth and it's pretty clear we're both excited about it. Then, after a little bit, eventually you'll trail off into sending a message every hour or so, sometimes letting one or two a day be all that happen, and I reply pretty quickly. Within the hour if I can, and if not, as soon as I'm free. Then eventually, I get cold feet due to our declining progress and see how we end up doing pretty little every session, and we sort of silently stop until one of us works up enough courage to actually speak to the other about doing another roleplay. Keep in mind, all of that scenario is from my perspective, and you've probably got a multitude of good reasons for replying as slowly as you do sometimes. I think that to myself every time I find myself complaining or getting antsy. Actually, I used to be a real fucking dick about it, and I'd try to match your reply rate instead of just replying when I could. And, actually, “match” is being kind about it. I remember being particularly agitated while I was on vacation one time and I didn't reply for, like, <i>three days</i> because it took you like twelve hours to get back to me or something. I felt like a real asshole about it afterwards and I think that might've been about the time I actually changed to just get back to you whenever I could.</p>
	  <p>In any case, that was basically all pretense to ask you if we could switch over to scheduling our sessions or something. The only days I'm <i>entirely</i> free, as I've mentioned, are Wednesdays and Sundays, but also, I'm like 90% positive that you don't want to schedule an entire <i>day</i> away for “oh I have to roleplay with this dude on the internet.” I'm not sure what to do, really. I don't want to <i>not</i> roleplay with you, I feel like you're my one-in-a-million chance at actually having somebody who can fill this incredibly specific hole in my life, but I can't keep up with this “will they, won't they today” system of roleplaying. With my life as it is, I'm actually kinda desperate to keep you, and even increase how often we roleplay (hence my “schedule an entire day” suggestion). I do think there's a nice middle ground somewhere here, which is probably somewhere along the lines of “scheduling an hour or so on Wednesday or Sunday for this dude on the internet,” and even though that's not as often as I'd like it to be, it is definitely a step closer to what I'd like. Now, I realize I've asked quite a bit of you in the past, so I can understand if you don't want to give up even more for me! Especially when one of the few things I said I'd do is to quit it with the website communication bullshit. I have my reasons (mainly that I think this as a conversation would be <i>super</i> uncomfortable, and I have no idea how I'd appropriately approach talking to you about this), but I don't think those make the actual scenario – me asking you for change while seeming to be pretty incapable of change myself – any different.</p>
	  <br><br>
	  <p>Anyhow, I don't expect a ton from you after reading this page. All I'd like is to know whether you'd be okay scheduling our sessions as opposed to sorta doing them whenever. I can't offer much else. Actually, that's not entirely true. I don't want you to leave this site without <i>anything</i>, I mean, at least not for having gone through the trouble of wading through my shit. Here's <a href="music.html">a link</a> to a page with a bunch of my music. This is all early access, stuff not even my soundcloud followers have access to. I haven't even shown some of my close friends this stuff. It's not a lot, especially if you don't like my music, but at least you aren't leaving <i>empty</i> empty handed.</p>

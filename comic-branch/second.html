	  <h2>TRANSCRIPT:</h2>
	  <p>Today's date... is July 4th, 2023. The current time is 3:46 PM. My name... is Alucard, but you knew that... uhm, Comic. Heh. Sorry, I've- I've recorded this... thirteen times by now, probably, and it's never been perfect.</p>
      <p>Uhm, I don't wanna <i>worry</i> you. Uh, I know it's called "PLAY ME" and it looks kinda cryptic, but don't worry about it. Uh, I just needed to say something... Well, a few things. I w- I wanna make one big point, and touch on a lotta things surrounding it, essentially.</p>
      <p>Uhm... Before that though, I should mention a few th- few other things. Uh, for example, why <i>this</i>? Why not just, I dunno, have this conversation with you? Um, part of it is because I don't wanna have that conversation... g- uh... Talking about things- Talking about my feelings like this, live, is a very scary thing for me and I think I would rather just... bundle it all up into this one <i>package</i> and then send it to you, let you... fully digest it, pun intended. Uhm... And the-hen-n- S- I do it for me, I'm- I'm- I crack myself up. Uh... And then... Then you can get back to me on it, right? And- And I- I'll just... be f-... Uhhh I would- I would rather just have a big bundle of worry and have it over with rather than have a- a longer... worrying conversa- not <i>worrying</i> conversation, but a- a sort of nervous conversation. Uh...</p>
      <p>Part of the reason is cuz I'm going to a baseball game later today, and so I can really just... <i>Send this</i>, and then not worry about it for, like, six hours, or however long baseball goes. It'll probably be until the AM, honestly, cuz they're starting at, like, 6:40... for whatever reas- Baseball takes a while, dude. 6:40 seems, like- there's so much time in a day, you could've done it so much earlier but whatever. Uhm... No, they do it that late to give people a chance to get offa work, I know why they do it, but in any case, uhm...</p>
      <p>I'll- that's my plan, too. I'll be recording this, uploading it to SoundCloud, and then.. sending you the link either <i>on the car ride there</i>, to the baseball game, or just before I go, in the case that I'm driving. Uhm... And then.. I'll just not worry about it and that'll be sick. Uh...</p>
      <p>Also, important to note, I have some things, I have some ideas... Or, I have some things I wanted to mention about the roleplay. It's a little long, and that's all in text, that's in the description. Uh, partially cuz I didn't want to... Eh- The message I have to say, the thing I have to say in this audio file would feel weird if I had to mix it with the roleplay stuff I think.</p>
      <p>Uh, maybe read the role play stuff first? It'll probably interest you more, I'm not gonna lie, but I don't recommend listening to this and reading the roleplay stuff at the same time. Uh, if you're listening to this over Discord, you'll have to click on the- you'll have to open the link I sent you to get to the description, which is where I have the... roleplay ideas and stuff. You'll have to open a separate link for that as well. I- I- I- don't know if SoundCloud allows, um... sort of... inappropriate content on- in their descriptions and I don't want to test it, I don't want to test their filter, so I'll- I just uploaded it to a different site. Um.... Buh- That's- that's less important. Um, I think I got everything out of the way.</p>
      <p>Uhh... yeah. So, I'll open by talking about... Last night. I had to... Well, I fell for a scam and then I had to delete my account. Uh, cuz it was compromised and I didn't want- I didn't want them looking at stuff, I didn't want them to send anybody messages, and... So I deleted it very quickly. Um... Most of my friends just told me to be more careful in the future and it's like, "Alright, well, no shit. Thanks for making me feel dumb." Uh, But <i>you</i>... You-You... you flipped the script, you- you had figured that obviously, after losing my account, I don't need to be told to be careful. I'm going to be more careful, I just lost an account. Um, and you told me "Well, at least you got it.. out of the way before it could.. send anybody else messages" and that.. I wouldn't say i-it-it... Flipped my whole understanding of it or anything but it- it-it widened the scope of what I was thinking about. And... We- Ah- I don't know! I- I felt a lot better after it- After that. Ah, and so... It ma- It makes it- Me pretty confident that you're.. friend worthy, like, material. Um.. Which is my point, actually, a proposition of sorts.</p>
      <p>I... I want to be your friend. I wanna- Nope. Wrong- Different lyrics. I was not thinking right. Anyways, um... But no, I do want to be your friend. Um.. I don't know. I don't know what we'd do. I know we share <i>some</i> similar interests. Um... I-I- Back- back to the story I was telling. I mean you were there, obviously. But um, afterwards... After you- you made me feel a little better about that situation, you told me.. or you didn't tell me, but it was a little bit after that you just <i>sent a friend request</i>. And like... I don't know.</p>
      <p>Eh- Before I had thought of it very functionally, where.. one of us - It's been so long, I don't even remember - one of us made a post to the VoreRoleplaying subreddit, right? And just- In order to talk to that person at all then, I- We- We- We could've contacted each other over Reddit, but... Obviously one of us friended the other over Discord, so we could talk! Uh, and that.. went well, obviously, we're still roleplaying. I mean, uh... And then we made the server, right? And then we didn't <i>need</i> to be friends, functionally speaking after that, but.. Uh, I didn't want to <i>un</i>friend you, that would seem mean, and frankly, I liked having you on my friends list. Uh...</p>
      <p>And sooo, then I had to delete my account because the whole. scam debacle thing.. And then you sent me another friend request and I'm just- Functionally, there's no... There's no function because we share a server. We don't <i>need</i> to do that, if you wanted to DM me you just could.<p>
      <p>So, I don't know! I don't know, I don't know, I don't know. It-It- It- It- It just... It really sent me into a spiral of like "Why would- What? Why would they do that?" It was- It wasn't a <i>bad</i> confusion, either, I want to note. It was a very... You sent a friend request that can only mean a good thing, right? Uh, and I've come to two conclusions regarding that. The first, and I believe more likely is that you just wanted to.. Return to- to how things were, return to the default, with me on your friends list and not the- not the old one on your friends list cuz that guy's getting deleted. Makes sense, right? Um... The other conclusion.. that I believe is less likely, but still affected my thinking on the matter, is that.. You <i>are</i> open to the idea of being friends, and that was a little hint that I should've taken. And I hope I'm taking it right, but also, I don't think it's the <i>most</i> likely explanation. I dunno. Um...</p>
      <p>But it- it is what inspired me to actually.. record this, and send it to you, rather than to just keep ruminating on these thoughts. Uh, I will note I've had them for a little- for over a month now, I sent you a friend request over <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/930219356737142864/1036362851918545046/friedoptimusprime-30102022-0001.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Roblox</a> a while ago. Uh and I checked recently and it's still not accepted, and I uh- I've come to two conclusions on this matter too. Uh, one is that you just haven't seen it, which I think is more likely. Uh... But the second, slightly scarier one, is that you've been ignoring it on purpose. Uh, but for a good reason, such as: not wanting to mix your friend groups. I know that I would be... Uh- I would be a little against.. introducing.. a <i>specific</i> friend of mine to you because I don't want them knowing that I'm into vore roleplay in the slightest. I don't want to even hint at that with them. Uh, and.. Have it- And having you two talk might make me nervous about them discovering that, obviously.</p>
      <p>And so, a very similar line of reasoning can be applied. I know that- I know you play Roblox- Sorry, my phone buzzed, you might have heard that. Uh.. I know that you play Roblox with at least three other people. You've sent me a clip, there was you, and then three other people having a very good time. Or so, it sounded. Um... And they might not know that you roleplay. And.. I don't... I don't want to ruin that for you? I d- I don't wanna- I don't wanna.. stomp on that, I guess. I don't- Like... If those are two worlds you wanna keep separate.. I wanna be as respectful of that as I can be, you know?</p>
      <p>Uh.. The same goes for this whole proposition in general. I- I've been kind of assuming this whole time that the answer would be yes, but straight up, I'm gonna be real, it's okay if it's not. Like... The- The last thing I want to do really is.. ruin the scenario- ruin the situation we have going now. Cuz your roleplaying - I'm gonna level with your here, buddy - is <i>really</i> good! I have not used the VoreRoleplaying subreddit in... However, long since I met you cuz I just haven't had to! I haven't had- like, you've just taken care of all of my sexual needs. It's actually nuts. Like, especially with our most recent roleplay, it's like you can read my goddamn mind sometimes! It's insane! Um... And I- I appreciate it a lot! To the point where it makes me nervous sending this cuz it's like, "What if i ruin it? I don't want to ruin it. I don't want to make things awkward, but also like.. I can't keep sitting on this."</p>
      <p>So, I hope- I hope, uh, you understand why <i>I've</i> felt the to send this and uh... Don't kill me, hahaha. No, but um... Seriously, I- I would like to know your.. thoughts regarding this- if you do or don't want to.. Uh, what you might suggest, I don't really...</p>
      <p>Ah, I feel bad for bringing up the Roblox thing now cuz like... I don't know. I don't want you to feel bad about having not seen it either... Cuz, if you just didn't see it, you didn't see it. Or, if you have been ignoring it, don't feel bad for ignoring it. Don't feel bad for ha- for not having seen it. That- Those are both... Complete like- If you just didn't see it, there's nothing you could have done, you didn't know about it. I didn't tell you about it until <i>just fucking now</i>. So, how would you have known? Um... You probably have a billion friend requests in your- in your queue.</p>
      <p>Uh.. in any case... I don't know. Um... I put- I-I- I told you about the link, uh, and how you might want to read that first cuz it'll- It relates to our roleplays, you know, it-it'll- It's actually helpful regardless of if you wanna... Be friends or not beyond what we have done. Uh, I will say. I-I- I know I touched on it earlier, I- I do... Worst case scenario, I want you to just ignore this, entirely. Like if you come away with a negative reaction to this and... And you don't wanna talk about this, let's not talk about it then, right? Like, that's okay. If this is weird and you think I'm <a href="data/awesome story.mp4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weird</a>, so be it, I don't care. L- I- The last thing I wanna do is- is ruin... The situation we have going on now.</p>
      <p>Uh... I think that's everything I wanted to say, then. Thank you for- for listening. Sorry if this was a waste of 13 of your minutes. Um... By the time you finish this, I will probably be... At the Timber Rattlers stadium. Uh, so... Message me when you can. Well, if yo-if you... If you- If you want to, I guess. I don't know. I'm worried that this might be taken in a bad way, but also I'm not gonna back down, I've already recorded it, it's too late now, so... Um, yeah! Happy 4th, by the way, happy 4th of July.</p>
      <h2>The Original SoundCloud Description</h2>
	  <p>Before you go to the link, I want you to know that you'll probably want to download the file and open it in a text editor. The website doesn't automatically wrap lines, so you're gonna have to scroll horizontally if you're reading it on the site:. But also, don't click on the link until you know what it is, pretty please. I will elaborate in the audio: <a href="https://paste.ee/p/OpsEX">paste.ee/p/OpsEX</a></p>
	  <h2>The Paste</h2>
	  <p style="font-family: 'MS PGothic';">Just a heads up, this is only going to be up for a week, so if you want to save this text, I suggest copying and pasting it soon.</p>
      <p style="font-family: 'MS PGothic';">I did have one scenario idea, but it would make more sense after I explain a thing or two. Also, just as a sidenote because I do believe I forgot to say anything about this besides that it exists, but I chose this instead of talking to you about this because it felt like a good way to offset the potential uselessness of the audio. Say you don't care for the proposition, at least you got something out of it, right?</p>
	  <p style="font-family: 'MS PGothic';">So, regarding Al, the character, I particularly enjoy when he takes on a subservient role. Like, beyond what a normal butler would do. Our most recent roleplay is actually a perfect example of the kind of lackey I enjoy Al being. Although he would agree to do those things anyway, he doesn't have a say in the matter, he is forced to do those things. Power play is a very big thing for me, and I think I've neglected to actually mention it, though I do think the whole dynamic of prey/pred implies I like that to begin with, just not that I'd enjoy it quite as much as I do. Expanding on that point: facesittng. There has not been a ton of it, and I would like more of it. I know it's probably not too interesting from the pred side of things - just sitting on somebody - but I'd like to work at making it not boring! For example, another thing I enjoy is when prey - especially Al - is not only sat on but forced to lick. If that's not up your alley, there's other ways to make facesitting less boring, like with more prey! Especially in our most recent roleplay, I could see Toya being sat on for being so apprehensive about his duties, and maybe anal vored as a result, while Al gets rewarded with a nice little laydown with the Queen. That's not, like, a euphemism either, Alucard is a very easily motivated character. Lying down with the Queen would be quite the reward for him. You don't have to take it in that direction, by the way. That's just one of many, many ways that scenario could unfold. I would encourage you to think of ways you'd enjoy it more, actually, though I do think Toya could go either way with being a servant or a snack at this point.</p>
      <p style="font-family: 'MS PGothic';">Two similar things I feel like I've neglected to mention: smothering and size difference. Smothering is another power play thing, but I very much enjoy it, specifically with my characters' faces. Face to belly when prey are being digested is especially hot, but really I'm just asking for more smothering in general. The scenario I'll talk about later touches on it a bit, you'll see what I mean. As for size difference, I have very weird preferences when it comes to it. Like, either I want a fairly big size difference, or I want the characters to be around the exact same size. But also, giantess is too much. I'm being a little vague, so here's an example of my ideal size difference:</p>
      <p style="font-family: 'MS Gothic'; font-size: 14px;"><a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/947987401022767185/1085677118580600842/FIHS3kXX0AALyIm.jpg">https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/947987401022767185/1085677118580600842/FIHS3kXX0AALyIm.jpg</a></p>
	  <p style="font-family: 'MS PGothic';">Even sitting, they're taller than their prey. This aspect will depend on which ref you choose for any given scenario though, so like, I don't know if that can be adjusted as easily.</p>
      <p style="font-family: 'MS PGothic';">Another thing, and this is really a me-issue more than anything, but... What exactly is going on when prey are shoved up your ass? Like, I feel kinda dumb asking, but they don't end up in the stomach, obviously. I assume they just squirm around in your hot guts, but like, I haven't asked for clarification ever. The preds I typically roleplay with have anal prey go to the stomach, so I'm just unfamiliar with it is all. On that note, because I'm unsure of the nature of this kind of anal vore to begin with, I'm not really sure if the same massaging technique works? Like, I genuinely can't remember, it's been a while, but I recall that the prey you take in anally typically don't bloat your belly, although I could be misremembering. This means that Al, for example, wouldn't be able to do the same belly massage/crushing down thing he typically does, right? And if that's the case, is there any way an eager feeder might try and help?</p>
      <p style="font-family: 'MS PGothic';">The last thing I wanted to mention aside from my scenario idea was Tobey. He's, like, the character I would like the most pain directed at. In a sense, he's sort of the opposite to Al. Whereas I like Al to be sort of the MVP (most valued prey) and kept around because he's helpful, Tobey I very much like being the last to be digested of his friend group (so he knows they're all dead) before being digested himself, probably in the vicinity of a skull.</p>
      <p style="font-family: 'MS PGothic';">So, my scenario. It's nothing too creative, it's actually based off the loose canon I have for my characters, but essentially all it would entail is a predator forcefully moving into Al's apartment. Initially, this predator "moves in" next door, although Al knows his neighbors, and he knows a family lives there with no plans of moving soon. Or, in this case, lived there. After a quick introduction from her on the premise that she wants to meet her new neighbors, she invites herself into Al's apartment and makes herself at home. In this case, I'd imagine that'd look like her pushing passed Al to sit on his couch. After he closes the door and walks over to her though, she makes her real intentions clear. She doesn't want to pay rent, and she wants to live somewhere where food is plentiful. If anybody asks, she doesn't live with him, and he doesn't know anything about the recent disappearances. It depends on exactly which pred you go with, and if we even play this of course, but I imagine the usual day would have her leaving the apartment for breakfast, coming back ~15 minutes to an hour later and having Al either help or be a seat or something, and doing something very similar for lunch and dinner, with the cherry on top being that she either clogs the toilet daily, leaving Al to clean up the mess, or - and this is grosser, I will say - she uses the much closer, furry, grey toilet that lives with her. I will say, I don't want that to last, I would like her to warm up to Al eventually, especially after seeing how obedient he is and how eager he is to help. I'd only like her to warm up to him so much though. Think of it almost like she's entertaining a pet who wants to help, y'know? Like she's nicer to him, probably doesn't use him as a toilet, but she still very much uses him as she would a toy, or say, stuffed animal. Another great thing to add - and I'm being very idealistic with my scenario idea, feel free to workshop this with me by, like, removing things you don't like - would be the smothering I talked about earlier. I would particularly enjoy if, because she's stealing his bed for herself, she still let him sleep there, but only if he acts as sort of a teddy bear for her. It sounds very sweet, and Al would actually probably be very enthused by this proposition, but being a stuffed animal isn't all great. I would imagine it starts off with Al getting to lay and maybe even cuddle up to the pred. Then, she'd roll over. It depends on the pred, obviously, but it won't be pleasant for Al in any case, being trapped under her and all. And that would probably go until morning, with her slowly stretching and getting up, probably having to peel Al off the bed. He'd be fine, like he wouldn't be dead, but also, he gets to look forward to that more often, as he can't back out of his teddy bear agreement now.</p>
      <p style="font-family: 'MS PGothic';">And, as for refs, I had a few in mind. Specifically for this scenario, I would much prefer one of the larger ones we have yet to use. There was one you actually posted very recently that I very much enjoy. In order of how much I'd like you to play them for this roleplay:</p>

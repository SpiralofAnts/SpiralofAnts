			Hello! You've reached the home-site of my creative endeavors. If you've found yourself here, you're likely welcome to explore. For now, mightn't I suggest <a href="https://spiralofants.github.io/SpiralofAnts/COMPUTER%20ADVENTURE%20GAME/manual.html">here</a>?
			<br><br>Or, perhaps, <a href="file:///C:/Users/Alucard/Documents/GitHub/spiralofants/samples/coolspot.html">here</a>?
			<br><br>And, before you ask, yes. This site is in shambles, and unfinished. Still, it deserves to live, no?

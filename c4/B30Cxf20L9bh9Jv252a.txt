Hello. My name is Seymour. I'm one of Alucard's "friends." If you're reading this, that means you're either Alucard stumbling upon his own old repositry or you're your Alucard's equivalent of Obrist. If you are Alucard, I need you to disregard this file and the folder its in completely. If you want an explanation, come talk to me, but do not touch these files.

If you are Obrist, which you are likely unaware of, you should continue. My name is Seymour. There is a slim chance you know me, potentially by another name. If you have access to this file, you're likely viewing the entirity of the c4 folder. If this is true, there should be another folder, named "package," and a file named "seymour.png." The latter is the one picture that exists of me.

If you're able to view and listen to the files within "package" and can make this known to me somehow, it would be greatly appreciated. However, you are not to pass this message through the mouse. If you're reading this for the first time, he's certainly not ready to hear any of this yet. At most, you should ask to talk to Seymour. If Alucard doesn't know a Seymour, don't fret, he probably will within the next year or so, but don't forget about this either. This package serves as a sort of test beacon, and the unique serial number at the end of it is unique to your copy of this package. Its important we track each individual code, so keep track of it if you can.

			<div class="body-text">Hi buddy.
			<br><br>I'm really sorry for not talking. Or, rather, not talking and poorly explaining why.
			<br><br>Y'see, on top of work, my weekly schedule also entails hanging out with Maxi, Amy, Bee, Snail, Avery & Elliot, Comic, Tony, Curio, Eli, and Felix. I don't even know if you know all of those names, but point is, those are just all the people I try and keep up with <i>actively</i>.
			<br><br>I... do not dislike these people. However, in making sure they all feel like they get enough time with me, I lose a lot of my own time. In fact, the time I <i>should</i> be using to catch up on your messages is being used to write this, right now.
			<br><br>Tonight is April 8th, 2024. Or, at least it just was. It's the 9th now, 00:10. We hung out yesterday and watched Dragon Ball, then I hung out with Maxi right after. During our call however, I told you I'd catch up with your messages. It's now the day after, you're asleep, and I haven't caught up with a thing.
			<br><br>Last time I asked, you reassured me I wasn't being a bad friend. But, some things you've said recently got me thinking, and I think I disagree. Before, when we were initially talking about my rate of replies dropping, you mentioned how me potentially never responding as frequently again "broke your heart." Only a week later, you had gotten used to it. "There's nothing I can do if you don't want to talk."
			<br><br>A good friend would not jerk their friend's emotions around like this. A good friend would not have allowed their friend to worry so much about them to begin with. I've been a horrible friend to you. Not for lack of trying, just... just because I failed! I failed to be a good friend. A good <i>person</i>.
			<br><br>There's very little use in crying over spilled milk though. Rather, I know the milk is spilt. Why not start cleaning it up?
			<br><br>Truth be told though, I'm not sure where to begin. I don't know how to explain my predicament exactly. Not only am I busy, but I feel like I've woken up recently too. Like, I've just realized I've been in a daze for the past while, and only now can I fight to escape it.
			<br><br>More specifically, I have been living for other people all my life. Not in <i>service</i> of them, per se, but I've been filtering my actions through the expectations and the wants and desires of others my entire life. I have never given <i>myself</i> space to breathe. "Never" isn't the right word, it almost never is, but it had very much felt that way since I started working at Jimmy John's, seeing as my schedule had to revolve around them.
			<br><br>I didn't know exactly how I felt at the time, just that I felt empty. What made me realize why I felt that way was you. Recently, you've had the courage to be yourself around me. We've been friends for how long and you only recently started being yourself? Now, I feel like I'm in a very similar situation. We've been friends for how long and I've only <i>now</i> realized how closed off I am?
			<br><br>It's not that I've been "lying" per se. If I've been lying to you, I've also been lying to myself the whole time. It's more like... my perception of "me" has been off, and I've been letting it drift further away.
			<br><br>Now though, with the time I've reclaimed for myself, I've introspected a lot. I don't know if I'm <i>that</i> different, but the ways in which I want to talk to you are much different from how I usually do. When I go to respond now, I don't know how. I refuse to let myself default to boring "hehehe" or "wow" messages, but I've got nothing to add to so much of this. I know you said my replies aren't expected, but... well, that's a lie. And we both know it!
			<br><br>It's not hard to see through either. If you don't expect me to reply, why message me in the first place? The truth is - I think - you just want to see more of me. You just want me to talk, to say <i>anything</i>... And instead of realizing this, instead of going along with it, instead of giving you <i>something</i>, I recede into myself. I fall back into my shell and I don't speak, for fear of hurting you with what I might say. But when will I realize my silence is so much more painful?
			<br><br><br><br>Anyways, sorry to wax poetic like that. I got a little off the rails near the end there, started crying. I'm glad to have gotten out of my system though. I'm glad you know I know
			<br><br>Because now... now there's no running from it! You know I can see the problem as clearly as you can! Or, at least, I hope I do. Of course, if I'm wrong, I'm sure you'll let me know. I trust that you'd let me know.
			<br><br>As far as an actual solution goes though, I'm afraid I'm still out of ideas. I'm sorry about not catching up tonight, but I felt it was more important to try and explain my thoughts. I feel like a real dick telling you to wait even longer, especially considering I already made you wait a week...
			<br><br>If there's anything you <i>gotta</i> tell me or anything you ever <i>really</i> wanna make sure I see, would you mind saving it until our day from now on? I don't want to waste our Dragon Ball time, I just wanna make sure I see the important stuff. I want to make sure the things you want me to see are seen, because I really, really care about you.
			<br><br><br><br>Just to cap this all off: I'm sorry again I couldn't do much catching up. I know I must sound like a broken record, but you're my best friend. Of all the people on that list - the list of people who I keep up with <i>actively</i> - you <b>are</b> my best friend. And so, I wanna make sure you feel that way.
			<br><br>And, to be clear, although I'm still not catching up on your messages tonight, I'm going to soon. I know it's been a vague "soon" for a week, but it's gotten to the point where I've begun crying at <i>work</i> over my ineptitude, so... safe to say, I'm feeling motivated to get better, and to actually try and catch up. Just, keep in mind that you might have to yell at me a bit. Kehehehehe, and that your emotions - especially the ones that make you wanna kick my ass into gear - are always justified.

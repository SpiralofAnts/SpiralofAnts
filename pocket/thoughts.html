					Hihi!! I made another page, as you can see. I just wanted to pop in and tell you a bit of a story. You're not obligated to listen, but I'd very much appreciate it if you stuck with me.
					<br><br>I've started thinking of people like ants. Not in the sense of, like, "oh I'm a god, everybody's beneath me," but like... I took this from Hank Green, actually, if you saw his recent comedy special "Pissing Out Cancer," but instead of thinking of people as colonies of ants, I think of people as individual ants. Allow me to elaborate.
					<br><br>Essentially, ants are little computers that do whatever their pheromone receptors tell them to do. Humans are <i>kind of</i> like that, in the sense that we definitely take in information and respond as a result of that input. We have free will, yes, but what exactly is free will? You can define it a number of ways, but I'm talking about the ways in which we're different from ants. It doesn't matter what the specific difference there is: I'm positing that it doesn't really matter all that much.
					<br><br>See, <i>my</i> sincerely held belief is that we are all, in a sense, big meat computers. Similarly to the ants, we take in what we know and try to do what we think is best as a result. We are, however, unlike ants and computers. Ants and computers have figured out, more or less, how to communicate flawlessly.
					<br><br>That isn't to say <i>all</i> ant-to-ant and computer-to-computer communication is perfect, far from it, but I also don't see any ants waging war over oil. That <i>is</i> to say: humans are horrible at signalling each other.
					<br><br>Take for example! A few weeks ago, I saw the opportunity to introduce someone to a game I find to be <i>really</i> cool. Because I was so desperate to have someone else who enjoyed the game in a similar way to me, I didn't stop for a moment to think if I <i>should</i> or not. I don't think inviting someone to play a game is a bad thing on the face of it, but I went as far as offering my Steam details to this person to get them to play. That wasn't the first thing I said either, I had offered to do that specifically because they said they may or may not pick it up (and because I already have my copy pre-ordered, it'd all work out perfectly). It may have already dawned on you, but I couldn't quite see how creepy I was being yet!
					<br><br>And I'm not trying to be mean to myself when I say that, but that was pretty overtly creepy. Like, I put so much social pressure on this person to play this game they may or may not care about, and went as far as to flagulate myself as to do so. Something <i>else</i> that may have dawned on you is that you are this person, Silent Hill 2 is the game, and I am <i>very</i> sorry for behaving like that. Obviously, you don't <i>have</i> to play the game, I was just excited to potentially have someone else interested in it. More importantly though, I don't want to be placing any weird pressure on you.
					<br><br><i>That</i>, I feel, is a pretty good example of my signalling issue. Instead of taking a more straightforward approach and simply saying something along the lines of "I think Silent Hill 2 is really really good for a variety of reasons and I think you should play it for those reasons!!" I effectively backed you into a corner in which I just fought your objections to playing it. You wanna know something though? You don't <i>need</i> a good reason. I mean, kehehe, don't get me wrong, I'd prefer a good reason, but <i>any</i> reason - so long as <i>you</i> are the one giving it - is the only reason I need! And I'd have to believe it's true, because it's the only one from you! Kehehehehe!
					<br><br>I have also, luckily, figured out the solution to my signalling problem!! You see, all problems that are caused by signals can be fixed by signals! The issue is, the party that doesn't understand the signal has to signal that they don't understand. And, uh, I think both our signal flags are kinda shot in that regard.
					<br><br>Now, I know I just said the word "signal" a lot, and a lot of that was wrapped up in metaphor, but I'm gonna attach us back to the real world real quick here, because I <i>believe</i> a really good example of that is happening as we speak!
					<br><br>Specifically, what I mean by that is, I think that we both occasionally get into pickles where there's no clear way how to signal the other party appropriately. For example, how does one say "I don't know how you want me to roleplay taking the lead in a mostly acoustic song where the other band members presumably won't do much - or if they <i>are</i> going to, they haven't made it terribly clear what." I <i>presume</i> you might've thought something along those lines at some point, but truly I can't speak with any certainty. If I'm correct though, I think I have good reason to believe you have.
					<br><br>A while ago, I'm not sure if you remember, but it's <i>burned</i> into my mind. A while back, I made a sort of recorded message for you then went to a baseball game, and I discovered that that just, like, <i>didn't</i> work when I got home. Instead of taking this as an act of god, I instead made two webpages - starting this GitHub site business to begin with! I don't remember the exact contents, but I had, at one point, mentioned that I just don't know <i>how</i> to be social correctly. And, while that's still true to a degree, my awkward response <i>also</i> used to be much worse. Now I have a pretty good idea of what I'm doing in most conversations I have- especially the ones with you.
					<br><br>I <i>think</i> you might be remembering this- along with some other times I was particularly emotionally... mmm <i>compromised</i>, shall we say, and deciding, perhaps, not to share a very complicated issue with no clear cut answer to me. Of course, because of how complicated human signalling is though, I <i>cannot</i> be certain.
					<br><br>I could be wrong, and if I am, <i>please</i> tell me so, but I suspect I've been lead to believe a little fib. See, its almost midnight, and your plan- as far as I'm aware- is to play Roblox with a friend until you find enough free time to respond. You're still playing Roblox, so I find it very probable that you're still playing with this friend, and still haven't found free time.
					<br><br>However, from roughly 10:30 to 11:15, we had a chat. I'm not trying to make you feel bad for talking to me- I'm happy you thought to do it. I <i>do</i> have to bring up, though, my thoughts as a result. See, if you've been playing Roblox <i>and</i> you've had enough free time to chat with me... it begs the question, doesn't it? What's wrong with the roleplay?
					<br><br>Now, because I've thought long and hard about it, I'm, 99% sure the reason we haven't continued is because you're not sure how and aren't comfortable telling me why. This is because <i>I've</i> put you in a very awkward position, and you fear that I'd feel bad for having done that. Well, <i>yes</i>, I would, but like I've been saying, I've been less awkward as of late! I know what I'd do! I'd apologize and suggest solutions to the root cause, like another particularly smart fellow I know!
					<br><br>Unforunately though, like I said earlier, without certain knowledge, I lack certainty, and thus the ability to act. If tonight really is a result of you simply not having any free time within that 5 hour span, that's also fine. I would just really prefer to know what happened, because right now, there's a certain ambiguity over all of this in my mind, and I'd like to know how to proceed without being a dick.
					<br><br><br><br><br><br>In any case, that's about all I had to say this time around. Actually! Before I go, I wanted to mention a time when <i>I</i> felt that I couldn't signal properly, but then did anyways, because I believed you could take what little emotional insight I had and make use of it. And, surprise, surprise! You did!
					<br><br>So, there was this time when I felt quite upset about what had happened in a roleplay. It wasn't anyone's fault. Well, no one's but my own. Essentially, somehow, I developed an intense empathy for Pavlov as he was being eaten. This has never been a problem for me before, but it certainly got in the way of continuing. Instead of telling you immediately, we wrapped up that night and we left that as-is. Then, I believe it was the week after, but it could've been as early as the very next week when you asked about continuing the Enn roleplay. <i>That's</i> when I spilled the beans, and you took it pretty well! I was emotional, though primarily because I was anticipating that news making you feel bad. As soon as you had made it clear that you were <i>fine</i>, I was a lot better. I had signaled so poorly, however, that I risked harshing your vibe <i>pretty</i> badly that day. And that's, like, the one thing I wanna avoid, right? It took me a <i>long</i> while and a good deal of introspection, but I feel like I have a much more balanced view of what happened and what I can do better.
					<br><br>Also! Considering the Enn channel still hasn't been touched, we should probably have a conversation about what we want to do about that. I know you had suggested rewinding to a specific point, but I'm not sure how we'd achieve it! Delete the messages up until when we're rewinding to? Simply respond to the last relevant message? Ehhh, I have my thoughts, but we should really talk about it considering just how many questions I can think of when we're not! Kehehehehe!
					<br><br>In any case though, I've been writing long enough about my silly signals, I think. Sorry for the long read! And I hope you're up to responding to this- even with as odd of an ask as that might be!

				Hello!! Sorry about it being a whole page again, but think of this like you would anything else I tell you. That is to say, don't feel like you have to reply. I just have a lot to communicate, and a single Discord message felt a little cramped. Mm, then again, this is just text... Gah! I'm getting distracted though. Kehehe.
				<br><br>So! For starters, thank you!! You have been <i>incredibly</i> patient with me, moreso than I really deserve, and you've been <i>extremely</i> understanding. I want to be very much like you in that way, although I've quite a ways to go. In fact, I know this, because... I'm <i>not</i> approachable yet!
				<br><br>Perhaps that's not the <i>best</i> way to word it, but, I think I'm detecting a certain apprehension to have a potentially difficult conversation with me. That, or I'm <i>waaay</i> off and I should be asking a different question at the end of this. Which, by the way, if that <i>is</i> what's happening, you should let me know that my sensors need recalibrating.
				<br><br>Specifically though, I'm referring to the 12th and the 19th. On both these days, we agreed on the furry-the-rock roleplay, and you said you'd be delayed replying on both days. On both days, no progress was made on furry-the-rock, though after a power outage on the 19th, you decided to put forth a relatively important conversation topic. Thank you for that, by the way. I'd been thinking about it, but I'd been <i>way</i> too nervous to share my thoughts without being prompted. After that, we <i>did</i> end up roleplaying, although it was something entirely new.
				<br><br>From my perspective, it initially seemed like you just didn't want to roleplay, which is like, whatever. But, after the 19th, it would seem an awful lot like you don't want to do the furry-the-rock roleplay specifically. Whatever the reason, I'm just gonna let you know, you're justified, but I also don't <i>know</i> the reason. I assume it relates to my most recent message, perhaps how technical I got... But theorizing doesn't do me much good. Without confirmation, I'll be taking shots in the dark. Plus, there's a much easier way to figure out what's up!
				<br><br>Unfortunately, that means that this is as far as I can go on my own. The only person who can fill in the gaps in my understanding is you now, buddy. Specifically: What're you thinking? Am I even right in assuming there's an issue with furry-the-rock at all? And, if so, what? <i>Can</i> it be fixed?
				<br><br>But also, don't worry about doing that right away!! I understand people are busy, and I understand I'm not your top priority. We have until Friday until we usually talk, and even then, it's not like I'm gonna <i>crucify</i> you if you don't reply to this. I'll be around regardless :)

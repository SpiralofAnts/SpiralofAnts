      <p>My name is Alucard, and this is the index page for my website. It's not super useful for anything, besides showing off my cool default formatting.</p>
	  <p>I'm surprised you found this page, though. I mean, it's a default for every github pages site to have, and having an index.html seems to be pretty default to the process, but still! There's no links to it on the site or anything.</p>
	  <p>In any case, feel free to explore the website. Here's the <a href="about.html">About</a> page, but I think the more interesting page to visit is the <a href="samples.html">Samples</a> page. Even if you're not interested in downloading said samples, there's some audio goodies there for you.</p>

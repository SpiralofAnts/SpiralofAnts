			<br>
			<div class="body-text text1">Unfortunately, by the title alone, some of you have already been lulled into a false sense of security. While this may be an adventure game played on your computer (more specifically through your browser) the word "adventure" may imply story. That's not to say there's <i>no</i> story here, but I <i>am</i> saying it's not going to be told to you. You must seek it out.
			<br><br>However, it's not even complete yet. Nowhere near it either! You, my adoring fans, will have to wait. Speaking of you fans, however, I would like to temporarily address you, right here in the manual of my game. I want to be clear though, our interaction will be fleeting, reserved for this message exclusively.
			<br>Firstly, this is my first delve into game design of any kind. I am a complete and utter hobbyist. As I'm a beginner, feedback would actually greatly be appreciated after this is all over. Email will be around.
			<br><br>And secondly, I've been made aware of some rumors regarding me and my game. Rather than acknowledge them, I'd like to tell my audience directly:
			<br>Do not let people put ideas in your head about this game. I'd even request you don't trust me as a wholly reliable narrator. The only thing that can tell you more about the game is the game itself - once it's ready.</div>

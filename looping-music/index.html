			To give a little more context, every piece of music on this page loops infinitely and seamlessly once begun, and it can be stopped and restarted at any time.<br><br>
			Additionally, only one song can be played at a time. I know this doesn't sound like a whole lot, but it took me roughly six hours just to get a skeleton of this working, and an additional three just to figure out how to get other songs to stop when you start one.<br><br>
			In any case though, this is just a proof of concept. I plan to make a few pages with much more songs so that the public might enjoy looped music, handily accessible from wherever they might be. If you'd like one, please contact me at <a href="mailto:orionaolsonforbiz.com">orionaolsonforbiz.com</a>, or, better yet, my Discord account highwayreckoning.

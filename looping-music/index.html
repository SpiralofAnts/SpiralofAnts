			<div class="body-text text1">Hey, heads up! Please be patient with the buttons. The way things are set up, when you click a button, it stops doing anything else until the song loads. That means if you click a button multiple times, it'll load the same audio multiple times and it'll sound weird, so please be patient!!<br><br>
			To give a little more context, every piece of music on this page loops infinitely and seamlessly once begun, and it can be stopped and restarted at any time.<br><br>
			Additionally, only one song can be played at a time. I know this doesn't sound like a whole lot, but it took me roughly six hours just to get a skeleton of this working, and an additional three just to figure out how to get other songs to stop when you start one.<br><br>
			In any case though, this is just a proof of concept. I plan to make a few pages with much more songs so that the public might enjoy looped music, handily accessible from wherever they might be. If you'd like one, please contact me at <a href="mailto:orionaolsonforbiz.com">orionaolsonforbiz.com</a>, or, better yet, my Discord account highwayreckoning.<br><br>
			And, for reference, <a href="original music">here's what a page like that</a> might look like.

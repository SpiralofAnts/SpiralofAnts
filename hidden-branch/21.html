			This topic's fun, because I don't actually have a ton to say about it!
			<br><br>See, “the world” I'm referring to is the one that our roleplays <i>usually</i> happen in. I know you've clocked it, you've asked me questions about it, but I don't know if I really explained what it is all that well!
			<br><br>It is, very roughly, a generic town where all of my characters can “canonically” live. Every roleplay is a variation of this city, in my mind. The Possum and Enn roleplays encapsulate this best, I think. If I recall correctly, actually, the Possum roleplay is what made Al live in B30 specifically.
			<br><br>Some interesting contortions of this town, I think, are the Cherry and Mitzy roleplays. With Cherry, time is being slightly altered so that everyone is in school at the same time, and a whole college is getting added to the town. The Mitzy one though? Strip clubs got <i>canonized</i> because I thought “where would Pavlov hang out?” and a crime syndicate got added to the town for that specific roleplay. Also, at <i>no point</i> did we specify Mitzy was happening in Mouseville, USA (extremely tentative title I came up with just now), but I think of it as happening there anyways!
			<br><br>Anyways, that's all I had on that one. However, in combination with the GM stuff I mentioned in the first topic, I think it would be neat if you had any ideas for the world! I want it to be interesting not just to me for me-reasons, but to you! For you-reasons!

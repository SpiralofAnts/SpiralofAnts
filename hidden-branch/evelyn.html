			We didn't do much, but from the little we did, I am so excited to continue this one!! I didn't expect her to be nearly naked from the get-go, but her comfort in the nude reminds me of a specific mouse who also wears One garment in the comfort of his own home. Not that Evelyn <i>lives</i> at the lab, but I also wouldn't be surprised if she slept there.
			<br><br>By the way, I was thinking about it a bit, and I think there might be something <i>really</i> interesting we could set up. Essentially, for cloning, we'd either need a DNA sample or some sort of scan of Alucard. I prefer the second method, specifically because we can then make this clothes and classes appear with each clone! And, theoretically, multiple snapshots of Alucard could be taken, kinda like save states in an emulator.
			<br><br>That's interesting thing number 1, but part 2 is to highlight a difference with these snapshots! I was thinking it would be interesting to have Evelyn gain Al's consent to clone and eat him (probably after he learns that it's going to/been happening anyways). And, also as a sort of heightening of that, I think it'd also be hot if she preferred the image of Al <i>without</i> the memory of consent (probably specifically because they struggle more, but what's Al gonna be left to assume from his perspective?)

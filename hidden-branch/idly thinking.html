					Hi! Another link, I know, but it's because I really don't want this to be a conversation. I don't think it <i>can</i> be, really. If it were, it would just be really upsetting I think! This is better as a sort of “rip it off all in one go! Like a bandaid” situation. So, this!
					<br><br>The reason I say that is because, last Thursday, I gave you advice for “locking in,” and the biggest part of that, I think, was “putting yourself in the other person's shoes.” In fact, in saying that, I realized that I could do that for you, by literally telling you how I feel by paying attention Friday.
					<br><br>I have done that now. And, to be clear, I think it is important you read this at <i>some point</i>, ideally before Friday, but literally whenever is good. But! This is kind of, like, an emotional thing, so I want you to read this when you have enough time and energy for that, and not a moment earlier.
					<br><br>That said, I'd also like to mention that I'm very grateful to have you of all people as my friend. You are not perfect, I believe the other half of this will make that clear enough, but it's clear you care. And I appreciate that a lot.
					<br><br>Here is <a href="otherside.html">the other half</a>.

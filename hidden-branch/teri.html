			I'm very excited to get to her! I say that, even though I keep forgetting to make the channel. <i>Especially</i> because – and I don't know if you know this about me or not – I'm a huge robot guy. I mean, the biggest idea I have for my world revolves around a silly otter robot, and when we talked about Fallout: New Vegas, I wasn't exactly <i>subtle</i> about loving the robits.
			<br><br>That reminds me! I was surprised to find out you haven't heard of the three laws of robotics. I dunno if you've looked them up since, but I find them important enough to mention and talk about because I'm insane.
			<br><br>1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
			<br><br>2. A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law.
			<br><br>3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law.
			<br><br>Obviously, these rules would break the scenario as we've envisioned it. <i>Digesting people</i> is certainly bringing them to harm. However, I believe I can come up with a slightly modified version of these three laws that work!
			<br><br>1. A robot must obey the orders given it by the company.
			<br><br>2. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm except when doing so would be profitable.
			<br><br>3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first and second laws.
			<br><br>Assuming the three laws of robotics <i>are</i> a thing, this is what the company would've done to them, I believe. The first rule makes sure that Teri doesn't wander off with some rando that got the confidence to tell her to walk away, but the second rule is modified specifically so that bosses can fire their employees. Unfortunately, employees are still human beings, and firing them <i>would</i> be allowing them to come to harm through inaction. So, to get around this, an allowance is made for profitable harm (such as an employee being let go). The third rule is unaltered though! It's fine as is.
			<br><br>The way these all interact is the interesting bit, I think! See, orders given “by the company” is pretty clear. Employees that rank above the robot get to push the robot around, makes enough sense. However, if the robot is allowed to harm for profit, and is told to, oh I dunno, fire someone, they might logically conclude that the more the profit, the better the harm. And the third law is the cherry on top! Assuming there's a robot operating under these rules that's, say, digested someone, they're going to be encouraged to lie about that fact to protect its own existence! 
			<br><br>Not that Teri is operating by the three laws, or any version of the three laws, but you can see how I think that'd be a fun way to explain those errors, right?

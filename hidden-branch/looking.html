					So, firstly, I'd like to apologize for the timing of all this. Your birthday is coming up here, and I'd really rather not spoil the buildup! Or, any of your time surrounding your birthday really! So, I have made the decision to postpone telling you any of this until at least a <i>week</i> has passed. The earliest you're going to hear about any of this is June 15th, although I should note that I've only written about June 7th here.
					<br><br><br><br>Alright! That out of the way, I want to tell you about my first major issue: communication. <i>Please</i> do it more often! That sounds kinda horrible coming from me of all people, but knowledge is power, and I'd really rather you trust me with that power! Otherwise, I'm going to find out myself that the reason you haven't replied in 30 minutes is because you're playing Sven Coop, and I'm not gonna come to good conclusions about that in the moment!
					<br><br>To be clear, what happened is that you took roughly thirty minutes to reply to a message of mine, and it was of pretty decent length, but I felt curious enough to check what you might be doing, because typically you don't take that long to reply. I saw Sven Coop, which is pretty notoriously a multiplayer game. I suppose there is the possibility you were playing it solo, but I'm not sure it's really fun that way.
					<br><br>My point is, however, that it really hurt to discover that. I came to the conclusion, in the moment, that you'd made the sporadic decision to hang out with friends rather than me. A day later, I have realized how silly of a conclusion that is, but that doesn't prevent me from having taken it the wrong way for a few hours already. What I <i>believe</i> has happened is that your Fridays are double booked.
					<br><br>Oh, yes! I've figured you out! Honestly, I'm surprised I didn't figure it out sooner, based on the few times I saw you playing tmodloader when I got home. The truth, I believe, is that you hang out with a group of friends every Friday. Who these people are and what your business with them is is none of my concern. I am simply taking it as fact that you enjoy the presence of these other people.
					<br><br>However, it is important to note that not everyone has that opportunity. The same Friday I caught you playing Sven Coop, I had turned down an offer to hang out with Amy and Bee, two IRL friends of mine. I <i>really</i> enjoy their presence, and I only get to see them once a week! To be clear, I don't want to hang out with them on our Fridays necessarily, but...
					<br><br>It becomes harder and harder for me, each time they offer, to honestly put them down. To put it in clearer terms, the choice they're effectively offering me is to hang out with them at their house, where we typically watch stuff or play games, but I really don't get the time to reply to you, which is like, the entire <i>point</i> of Friday!!!
					<br><br>...However, I cannot help but feel that this is not a reciprocal thing. I don't think you should necessarily have to make the choice between me and your other friends, but I do, and making the appropriate choice is getting harder. I suggest we reschedule! I can move my dates around pretty easily <i>except</i> for Saturday. That's the one day you can't have.
					<br><br>Also! I would really appreciate if you were to just tell me your plans more. I really dislike learning that the time I've scheduled with another person is being spent on people outside that agreement â€“ but also! I believe a smarter person would've realized you were double booked <i>much</i> sooner, and perhaps you think of me as smart.
					<br><br>In any case, sorry for stretching your time so thin on Fridays. If I realized what I was doing, I would've offered to fix it a lot sooner! I very much want your focus, and if you haven't even been getting a fair shot at <i>trying</i> to lock in, that's an issue.

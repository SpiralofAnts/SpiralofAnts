					Hello! I'm very excited to speak to you again on Friday! So excited that I broke my own non-existent rule and sent this link on Wednesday.
					<br><br>I'm gonna shoot straight with you and tell you exactly how I feel, with the benefit of writing. Rather than record myself rambling, I've thought carefully about every word I've included. At the very <i>least</i>, I've ensured I'm not saying anything I don't want to.
					<br><br><br><br>So! To start off, <i>apologies</i> for sending a link rather than just sending a message. After the links I've sent in the past, I imagine receiving these can be anxious. No weird “I have a problem” rant or emotionally packed rambles here though!
					<br><br>What this <i>is</i> is... Well, and odd exercise.
					<br><br>See, for whatever reason, I can't start a conversation outside of the one I usually do on Friday. I say “whatever reason,” but it's just because I'm too nervous to break precedent without explaining myself, and then I have to explain what I actually <i>want</i> to talk about, and the idea becomes so bloated that it ends up as a web-page rather than a Discord message! So, sorry!
					<br><br>However, I <i>am</i> able to express my intent! I very much want to have conversations with you outside of Friday!! And I don't mean roleplay! I mean, don't get me wrong, it would be fun to roleplay more, I certainly don't mind, but what I <i>want</i> is to talk more.
					<br><br>For lack of a better way of putting it, you make me feel normal. Not that other people make me feel <i>abnormal</i>, but I very much feel at odds with most people. When I talk with you though, and when I express my ideas, it genuinely feels like I'm trying to be understood! That conversation we had about music genres? I was so moved simply by you feeling a similar way to me about genre that I <i>cried</i> afterwards!
					<br><br>And so, quite naturally I think, I would like to speak with you more! Unfortunately, my time is really tightly bound, and the little of it I do get to myself, I usually squirrel away. I want to change that though!
					<br><br>In that effort, I've come up with a page or so of <a href="conversation starters.html">conversation starters</a>! I call them conversation starters, but to be clear, it's just a few comments and ideas about some of our current roleplays. It is stuff to get the ball rolling though, and stuff that I think could be replied to!
					<br><br>Whenever you reply (<i>if</i> you do), I'll try and get to you by end-of-day! Latest you'll hear from me before Friday is Thursday at 10 PM though. (Really hitting that “before Friday” time slot effectively, I know)

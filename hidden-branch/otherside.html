					I'm not exactly sure how I should start this off. I don't want to be mean, but what I have isn't... well, it's not nice to say! In fact, before I started writing this, I had a very long debate with myself on whether I should or not.
					<br><br>With most of my other friends, I try and call with them. This is because, unlike with the textual medium, I <i>cannot</i> disguise when I'm hurt in a call. I am emotionally exposed via audio, because there can be very little filter between when I am told something  and when I respond to it.
					<br><br>As an example, I was calling with Felix a few months ago. We were speaking completely hypothetically, and he told me my summary of a movie was subpar, and would've led to him regretting watching that movie with me. <i>Completely hypothetically</i>, this scenario made me <i>literally</i> cry. He even explained his thought process a bit afterwards. Initially, he thought I just had a frog in my throat, but after a minute or so of that not changing, he figured he said something and then asked me about it.
					<br><br>Textually, that is an exchange that cannot happen. When you say something, I literally have all the time in the world to reply. I do try and respond in a timely manner, but sometimes I just can't get the words out, so I'll just sit there and stare at the computer screen. Eventually I'll end up talking to myself, and even further down the line, I'll actually manage to type out a halfway decent reply. However, I never say when I'm hurt. To do so would be a conscious decision. And, knowing that your actions directly lead to it would probably hurt! Meaning I have to make the conscious decision to hurt you by telling you shit! Which really sucks!
					<br><br>I am sorry to have made it, but I made it for a reason. I trust you to take what I've written here and really do something about it. You've proven time and time again that you care about my feelings, which is why I trust you with them. Understand that they're not meant to hurt you, just that I really think that they're probably going to.
					<br><br><br><br><br>With all that out of the way, I'd like to begin by giving you a hypothesis of mine. I think you have plans on Fridays and haven't told me. And, as such, I'd like to reschedule to Thursday perhaps. Whatever time would work better though!
					<br><br>The reason I've come to this hypothesis is... I cannot find any other reason to play Sven Coop. It's not just a game you boot up randomly. It's, like, multiplayer only! I suppose theoretically you <i>could've</i> been playing it singleplayer, but I'm not sure it's fun like that.
					<br><br>The alternative, however unlikely, is that you made the sporadic decision to hang out with your friends over me. That... would hurt. A lot, in fact. Even so, I would prefer to know. That way, nobody would be hurt.
					<br><br>I do not believe this to be the case. I very much don't want it to be, at least. Regardless, most of all, I want you to be honest with me. I want you to tell me when you plan on playing with people, especially on Friday, because that's the one day I week I set aside specifically for you. If you're going to be doing something else, I would really like to know. I don't get to hang out with my friends and you, unfortunately. I have to make the decision between you and my other friends.
					<br><br>I don't necessarily think this should mean you have to make the decision between me and your other friends, but... When I have to make the choice over and over again, it gets hard to keep making the same choice when the other person does not have to. And I don't <i>want</i> to hang out with Amy and Bee on our Fridays necessarily, but... At some point, I have to seriously look at their offer of hanging out in real life and compare it to the average 1.3 messages an hour I get and... And I have to choose! And that choice sucks!
					<br><br><br><br><br>Sorry about flying off the handle at the end there. I just... I really do have to make that choice, y'know? And it's very demoralizing to put a lot of effort into a message only to find out half an hour later- not from you telling me, but from me looking- that you're playing a multiplayer game. From now on, I'd like you to treat me like a little stupid baby and tell me when you plan on playing with friends, because I'm really not good at picking up on it, and when I do, it's often too late, and I feel shitty about it. Or, planning on taking a break at all, to be clear.
					<br><br>And, about rescheduling, I was very serious about that offer. From how often I see you playing tmodloader when I get home, and from today, I can <i>tell</i> that you have plans to hang out with a specific group of friends on Friday. That, or you just happen to hang out with them a lot on Friday, and I don't want to cut into that. The only day completely off limits is Saturday, I can't reschedule that one, but feel free to suggest any other day! I do seriously want to have your focus, and for you to have an honest shot at focusing.
					<br><br>Oh! And, on a smaller level, I actually do have an idea for making things a little smoother. What if, when I start worrying about my last roleplay reply being incomprehensible or not up to par or whatever it is that I usually worry about, I send a little message in #general that just says “timer.” It doesn't have to be that specific word, I just want there to be a shorthand for, like, “hey, I'm worrying that I'm stupid or something,” so that you can reply with something along the lines of “don't worry, stupid. It's nothing to do with you, but you <i>are</i> stupid.” Not verbatim that, obviously, I don't think you have that in you. Kehehehehe!
					<br><br>Anywho, if you've made it to the end, I'm <i>very</i> interested in what your thoughts on everything are. Honestly, while I do consider myself to be more or less “over” everything I mentioned, I would not mind an apology! I feel a little silly asking, but I felt kinda really shitty when I really did put a lot of effort into my reply, and I found out you responded 30 minutes later because you were playing Sven Coop. I don't think you <i>intended</i> to make me feel that way, I don't think that was even remotely a part of your decision making process, but it was a <i>choice</i> to play video games. I would just prefer that, in the future, you also make the choice to tell me.
					<br><br>On that note, I also want to apologize! I would've spoken up earlier, had I not thought it to be too hurtful. I didn't want to ruin the mood for your hangout, or our roleplay, so I simply said nothing. I do believe it's important for me to say <i>something</i> though.
					<br><br>Additionally, even though I <i>tried</i> to find a nicer way to word everything, I do believe I failed. I mean, I think all of this is nicer than what I would've said in the moment (I also would've gone on a few unrelated tangents if I allowed myself to ramble about my feelings), but it's still not tonally neutral. I am still bound by my own perspective, in the end. So, it's also my bad for that.
					<br><br>Anyway! I've been typing long enough. I made my awkward request for an apology, but moreso than anything, I actually want feedback on my solutions! I think rescheduling is definitely in order, and although I really like my “timer” idea, I can also see how that could be quite rude, so I definitely want to know how you feel about that.
					<br><br><br><br><br>Also, <i>kind of</i> related, I made a <a href="https://youtu.be/DpYwnYjzZqY">pretty cool video</a> on Friday. I say "kind of related," because on a technical level, it's kind of... vent art, I guess? I don't wanna get more specific, because I think that would take away from the cool vibes of the video. Then again, the "cool vibes" I'm picking up on could just be an artifact of <i>me</i> watching it. There's an 80% chance you watch that very same video and cringe.

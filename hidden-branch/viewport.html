					Hello! I really do regret the amount of speaking I'm doing via webpage as opposed to Discord, but at the end of the day, it's all words on a screen, yeah? The important part is that I'm communicating in a way I can talk more or less comfortably, and I hope you're more or less comfortable reading.
					<br><br>If you're not, by the way, and if you'd prefer I send you looong messages instead of webpages, I am perfectly fine with that! However, after perusing the rest of this, I suspect you might come to agree with me, in that this might be the best way to say this.
					<br><br>So, firstly, I wanna make it very clear what this is about. Last Thursday, you mentioned having trouble “locking in” on our Fridays, as well as for some of your other friends. I tried to give you general advice that applies to <i>my</i> situation, and it doesn't seem to have helped.
					<br><br>Initially, I thought that writing this was akin to helping you lock in more, but to be honest? This link is more for me. I'm being greedy in telling you this, because I'm sending this so I feel less shitty at the end of the day. That is something that <i>only</i> affects me, and in telling you, it has the high probability to hurt. So, I'm sorry.
					<br><br>All that said, now that you're aware of what this roughly is, I would like you to... not <i>ignore</i> it, but shelve it for a moment. I want you to assess your current situation. Are you ready to read on, you think? I did feel the need to let you know about this, but the last thing I want to do is worry you, or have this matter all that much.
					<br><br>We have infinite time. The world isn't ending. I <i>was</i> upset at some point over these things, but I am not anymore. In fact, I've even rationalized it all pretty well, I think!
					<br><br>Y'see, I <i>was</i> hurt. That much is a fact. However, me hurting was not the primary function of your actions. Me hurting was an unfortunate biproduct of the actions you took, and so I'd like to influence the decision making that led you there in <a href="looking.html">the least harmful way possible</a>.

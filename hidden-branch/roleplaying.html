			I've been thinking about how I roleplay a <i>lot</i> recently. I mean, you know that to some extent, obviously. We had to rewind Enn's scene just to accommodate my relatively new feelings.
			<br><br>And, strictly speaking, we haven't actually <i>done</i> that yet. Not that it's urgent! But, at some point, we're gonna have to decide precisely when we're rewinding to, and then do the awkward shuffle of deleting our messages. Actually, thinking about it, we'll probably just end up replying to the last “canon” point. Ooh, fun! I didn't think about it like that, but we <i>are</i> deciding our canon here!
			<br><br>In any case though, I bring up roleplaying because I've learned something important again! And while I think it's kind of silly to leave it in an optional part of a link I'm sending you, I'm <i>positive</i> I'll tell you one way or another. I'm a GM!
			<br><br>That is to say, I've played Dungeons & Dragons (5E) for a while now, and I enjoy DMing! In fact, I enjoy it for a lot of the same reasons I enjoy roleplaying, and I enjoy roleplaying a lot in D&D! I'm surprised I didn't come to the conclusion sooner, but I could absolutely be more of a GM when it comes to our roleplays!
			<br><br>I say “could” because, while I want to, I also <i>don't</i> want to if you enjoy what I do currently more. I figure you don't mind me trying, but I want to clear it with you!

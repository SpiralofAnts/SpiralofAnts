			My time situation is a little delicate. Some of you <i>may</i> have a vague understanding of this from me mentioning how little free time I have, but I want to be crystal clear for those who might be a bit hurt by my lack of being around.
			<br><br>From Sunday to Saturday, a full week around the clock, I have roughly four contiguous hours that aren't scheduled for <i>anything</i>. Every other minute of my life is promised either to work, to a friend, or to sleeping. And even then, in favor of art, I ignore my scheduled sleeping hours sometimes.<br>Simply put, my social battery has not recharged in some time. The reason I don't talk to you, my friends, outside of our scheduled time per week is because I need that downtime. And, seeing as how nobody is interested in losing their slice of time with me, there is nothing I can do. If I act to take time away from someone in favor of someone else, there is a party that will feel slighted.
			<br><br>This is where I am with my time. I apologize that this has been so hard on some of you. Keep in mind, however, that there are some people who are even unluckier. Some people choose to be my friend and don't get <i>any</i> weekly time with me, despite deserving it. These people - my <i>friends</i> - matter to me, but in the little time I get to myself, I simply forget to get back to them. And it sucks! I feel bad, they feel bad, no one wins.
			<br><br>I know this is selfish, but something <i>has</i> to change. I need to stop feeling bad. And so, now you know how little time I have. And still, I care to try and talk to you. If you're reading this and you're one of the few people who doesn't get any weekly time with me but still wishes very badly to talk with me, I would not worry too much. Message me. Yell at me to respond to you! I have the feeling that, having finally explained my time situation, I'm going to have a bit more free time.

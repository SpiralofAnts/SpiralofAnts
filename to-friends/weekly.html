					"dream theme"
					<br>Made last Tuesday with some help from Amy. She effectively chose the samples we were going to use, and I churned up a cool little string loop.

					<br><br>"No Surprises Snippet"
					<br>This is a small bit of <i>No Surprises</i> by Radiohead. Particularly, just the beginning bit, because I wanted to demo some instruments.

					<br><br>"Fiberglass Monkey"
					<br>I've been singing a lot more to myself as of late, and I want to, like... <i>do</i> that, so I've been thinking of covering songs. <i>I'm</i> still embarrassed about my voice, but that's just gonna be me forever I think. Anywho, this one is a cover of <i>Fiberglass Monkey</i> by Lemon Demon.

					<br><br>"jacked up opener"
					<br>I did a TON of shit on Monday, starting with this. When I made it, I was sort of conceptualizing an album, with this being the first track. Don't think that'll come to fruition, because it probably won't, but cool idea, right?

					<br><br>"yuppy guitar"
					<br>This is the second thing I made on Monday, and it was pretty alright, I think. No Mozart Concerto certainly, but that guy also never heard of Lemon Demon, so what does he know?
					<br><audio controls><source src="new/yuppy guitar.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></audio>
					<br><br>"Ana Ng"
					<br>This is a cover of <i>Ana Ng</i> - if you can believe it - by They Might Be Giants. <i>Really</i> good song, IMO, which is why I'm making a cover of it.
					<br><audio controls><source src="new/Ana Ng.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></audio>
					<br><br>I had a vision of a mask of a kingfisher bird. There's quite a bit of text on the page. From top to bottom, left to right, it says:
					<br>"Violet", "Orchid", "Kill", "Canon colors", "Dreams of a Kingfisher", "eye holes", "red cheeks", "Coolest kingfisher bird mask conceptualized of since 1991", "Could you imagine if the mouse just started wearing masks?", "Devilishly handsome", and "especially this one with a white suit, augh..."
					<br><br><img src="new/20240516_042152.jpg">
					<br><br>Although a colored version of the front-facing mask wasn't made initially, through recent breakthroughs in Digital Image Recovery (DIR), we can show you what this mask <i>would've</i> looked like from the front, colored!

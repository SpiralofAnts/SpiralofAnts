					"No Surprises Snippet"
					<br>In the spirit of singing, I've been doing that. This is a part of <i>No Surprises</i> by Radiohead. I was thinking of making a full cover, but if that's the case, I have a <i>lot</i> of covers to make. Like, an album's worth or two for sure.

					<br><br>"Split Into Two"
					<br>This is an original piece where I sing. I'm much more proud of it, considering the content, and it's nowhere near done yet! I've got an A section and <i>barely</i> a B section, but we'll see where it goes.

					<br><br>"Word Disassociation"
					<br>So far, this is just <i>some</i> of the piano from the opening of <i>Word Disassociation</i> by Lemon Demon. Very basic transcription, but I made it because it's one of the covers I might (will) do.

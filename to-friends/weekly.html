					"RPG proto"
					<br>This was made rather... unintentionally? I had no clear purpose in mind when writing this piece, I just had a string chords idea (which later turned into the electric piano) that I needed to get down.

					<br><br>"The Feeling of Friends"
					<br>This is similarly just a feeling I had to make sure I could capture. The name, however, is a little more about the feeling I was trying to capture rather than where I feel the song could be applied.

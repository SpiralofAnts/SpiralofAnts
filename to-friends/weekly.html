					"insane idea"
					<br>I was told to make "clown final boss music" for a Dark Souls-esque project. This is what I came up with within two hours of being told that.

					<br><br>"funky music"
					<br>This was song I had in my heart one night late at night that I transcribed before passing out.

					<br><br>"monkey rhythmoid"
					<br>This is in the same boat as "funky music" artistically speaking.

					<br><br>"Poison Mind (restored)"
					<br>So, Mint came up with this silly hypothetical in which one of the composers for the original Castlevania on the NES was actually employed by a funeral home who hated her music before passing her along to Konami. This isn't <i>true</i>, but I enjoyed the idea enough to make the lie real.

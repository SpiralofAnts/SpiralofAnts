			Hey! You're friends with a real idiot. I mean, we're talking a class act clown here. Somebody who, despite having claimed to take his head out of his asshole multiple times now, still hasn't yet!
			<br><br>I'm being a little hyperbolic obviously, but I'm still not talking like my usual self! And you have no way of knowing!! So, I'm gonna detail three things for you. 1. My plan to actually, finally take my head out of my ass. 2. My general plan with all Fridays going forward, and 3. The full extent of how stupid I am, particularly how it's affected us just today.
			<br><br>So, starting with one, my plan for dropping my dumb stupid filters is uh... Well, I've already started doing it! "Plan" is a strong word. I just genuinely have to get used to being myself around you, and so I've begun doing that! If I say something too out of line, I'm sure you'll let me know. Kehehehehehehe!
			<br><br>As for two, that's pretty simple. See, usually, I get home and I ask my opening question which presumes you want to roleplay, because why else would we be talking? Thing is, I actually wanna talk to you outside of roleplay, I'm just horrible at it! Send me memes and I don't see 'em until it's way too late. Wish me a happy holiday, and it's in one ear out the other!
			<br><br>The solution? Rather than asking about roleplay or what we wanna do that day, I think I'm gonna ask you about your day, or maybe even your week. What you've been up to, if anything's new.. whatever! Y'know? Then, without segwaying gracefully at all, I'm going to ask you IF you want to roleplay today, not which roleplay you'd want to do.
			<br><br>And honestly, that's all for my second point. I just wanna be better at talkin' to ya, so I'm gonna! Finally though, we reach my third point: the extent of how my shitty conversation skills affect us.
			<br><br><br>It's no secret that I'm a bad conversationalist, but did you ever expect me to just straight up lie to you because I'm ashamed and stupid? If so, wow do you have a low and eerily accurate opinion of me.
			<br><br>So, earlier today, you asked us to look at our old build-up of refs and consider them for the next thing we did. We did that, and you found four, I found one.
			<br><br>Instead of just telling you about my idea, I claimed I zoned out and thought of nothing, actually. Truth is, I was thinking about an idea I've had for months and I've just kept ignoring every opportunity to make it known.
			<br><br>But because I only lied about having an idea, and not about having found a ref, I got to put forward the one ref that could finally fit my idea without actually attaching that idea to her. Real genius move, I know.

			<br><br>Basically, Al was to be her lab assistant. She lost the previous few under "mysterious circumstances" that nobody investigates. To keep it that way, she invented a genetic sequence incubator. Or, in laymen's terms, a cloning vat. Her next lab assistant would be the guinea pig for it.
			<br><br>And there's different ways this could go too. For a more hard-lined science approach, we could have every clone start fresh without memory, but that's a liiittle boring in my opinion. Stretching the rules of science a bit here, experimentation with cloning could result in the clones starting with the collective memory of any and all clones (and the original) before them. Clones made during the lifespans of other clones won't receieve those clones memories, only the ones of those who died.
			<br><br><br><br>That's the idea, anyway. I feel a little better having told you, but the situation still kinda snowballed outta hand. Now, because I waited this long to say anything, we've already made plans.
			<br><br>Normally, I wouldn't do this. I feel embarrassed, having to go back on my word but... because I refused to admit it earlier, I need to ask now.
			<br><br>Do you think you can make an exception? Can we go back on our planning, just this once? All I'd want is for Evelyn to be switched out with someone else. I really do enjoy the idea, just not her in particular being the ref for it. And, for the record, I would understand if the answer is "no," it was entirely my fault we got to this point, and I shouldn't have to ask this to begin with.
			<br><br><br><br>Anyways, sorry for the length of this thing. I was aiming for shorter, but got carried away a little. Just for your reference, the only part of this I really want a reponse to is my question. Everything else is a lot of information you <i>should</i> know, but like... Dude, I have a hard time replying to casual conversation, how can I expect anyone to have a graceful response to <i>this?</i>
			<br><br>Anyways, it's 1:38 AM as of finishing this, I'm gonna lie down. If you want to talk about this tonight, I'm more than happy to! You'll just have to catch me quick. And, honestly, having to read through all of <i>this</i>, I might just stay up another thirty minutes to actually give you a chance. If not though, goodnight! Sleep tight, and sweet dreams! Kehehehehe!

			Hello again!
			<br><br>I've been writing a bit of these site-messages as of late. I'll be honest, I don't know how much you like these "letters," but they're rather efficient from my point of view! And so, I'll be unapologetic about writing this. Although, I do think this might be one of my last ones, if not the very last.
			<br><br>Those are big words coming from someone who's said just about that exact thing before, so let me explain my thinking. The difference between then and now is that, back then when I said I wasn't going to need to rely on these, I had no idea <i>why</i> I felt the need to write them to begin with. Now, I do! And, it's a lot of things I won't get into, but the main reason is because it's very hard for me to be emotionally honest with myself sometimes. Sometimes, I'll hide from emotionally hard hitting truths and won't think about shit simply because it'll make me feel bad, and that's not healthy!
			<br><br>This is a kind of tangent, but I <i>swear</i> it's related. As I write this, it's Wednesday morning (1:06 specifically), so basically the tail of Tuesday night. As you may or may not remember, Tuesday is my Amy & Bee movie night, and tonight we just happened to watch Pink Floyd's <i>The Wall</i>. I have a lot of opinions on it, but delving into that is another subject matter entirely. Watch it if you can though! It's really good! Point is though, it made me think about society, particularly the one I live in, and the one that shapes me.
			<br><br>I have been beholden to society for a very long time. I've let the people around me dictate how I <i>should</i> be, without really critically thinking about <i>why</i> they want me to act the way they want me to. Really, I shouldn't even have to think about why they want me to do what they do, I should just know that I'm not <i>actually</i> beholden to society! Like, society has specific rules that I have to play by, but within those parameters? I can do <i>whatever</i> I want!
			<br><br>You think somebody who does roleplays involving vore would already have some grasp on the idea that just because society thinks something is weird or undesirable doesn't <i>actually</i> mean that thing is undesirable no matter what, but here we are! I've somehow let this great contradiction slip under my radar all this time!
			<br><br>And this leads me to a certain conclusion. Y'see, I've been sorta lying... to like, everyone. You, my friends, even my closest family. Out of a desire not to be judged by these people, I've simply hidden parts of myself away. The thing is though, I'm not <i>actually</i> ashamed of the aspects of myself I hide. Not really, anyway. Or, perhaps it's more accurate to say that I <i>know</i> I shouldn't be, but I in some deep-rooted way, I am. And, thusly, if I'm not expected to be beholden to society or it's rules of "normal," why have I been giving a shit? Why have I been trying to act so normal in front of other people when I know I'm not? And, if I'm not ashamed, why don't I act like it?
			<br><br>These are all questions that I'm not sure I have the answer to. However, I do have a solution to the problem I've been having! And that is to <i>actually</i> stop caring. <i>That</i>, my dear Comic, is the difference between my thinking from long ago and right now. Right now, I do <i>not</i> care about how normal society might judge me to be. Including you, to some degree. Obviously, if you called me weird to my face unprovoked, I'd want an explanation, but I wouldn't disagree necessarily; especially considering the chances of you saying this to be harmful are slim to none. If anything, it's just an objective scientific observation!
			<br><br>I can't promise this state of mind forever. It's <i>really</i> liberating, but ultimately, living under the visage of "normal" is safer. Mm... That is, for most people. <i>You</i>, my dear Comic, are not most people however. You are distinctly different from most people. There is one particular thing, in fact, that I can point to to confirm this simple fact. <i>You</i> are my friend.
			<br><br>Most people would not be friends with a mouse of my nature. I am, to restate, <i>weird</i>. And intensely contradictory at times. To most people, I am simply an oddity to either be oggled at momentarily or ignored entirely. Neither of which I mind, but you do neither. Kehehehehe, although that isn't to say I mind what you do either! It would be extremely silly of me to be upset with the notion that my friends are being my friends.
			<br><br>No. I am simply highlighting this <i>major</i> difference between most people and you. I'm not sure what - if anything - ties all my friends together, aside from the fact that you have all decided to go against the grain in befriending me. I understand that this isn't easy, either. Dealing with me, that is. I do thank you for your patience though. Your role specifically, Comic, in my crawling out of my shell cannot be understated.
			<br><br>You in particular gave me an <i>incredibly</i> open space to have my philosophies and ideas - embodied by the wills of my characters - play out in interesting fashions. Like a sandbox of stories. And not only in roleplay either! Because of you, I started actually thinking about my characters again. In a very real way, without you, I wouldn't have started work on Computer Adventure Game.
			<br><br>...Have I mentioned that to you yet? I suppose, being one of the people I <i>most</i> hid from, I haven't. That's not your fault, by the way. I mean, in a roundabout way, it kind of is, but only because you were so nice! You gave me the freedom to be myself. And, when someone thinks they can't be themselves, it's rather scary to be given permission - <i>told</i>, in a sense - to act freely. I've been doing a similar thing to one of my best friends as of late, and I'm similarly unhappy with my behavior towards them.
			<br><br>Things are different now, however! Like I said earlier, my thinking has evolved. Society's definition of "normal" has much less bearing on me than it did before. I've been responding to my friends outside of the usual "alloted times" I have to interact with them. And, I don't want to give you false hope or anything, especially considering my free time is still rather restrictive, but there is a good chance I'm actually going to start replying to you now.
			<br><br><br><br>Actually, speaking of our interactions, I wanted to share my thoughts on last weekend. Late Saturday into Sunday in particular. Friday night, I straight up told you I'd be available "if my friends said like they said they would," which like... That <i>implies</i> a level of uncertainy, but doesn't confirm it outright. I shouldn't have hinged plans on an unclear "if" statement like that, but I learned! I also learned to be less of an ass, because immediately after my last friend left at 6 AM, I felt bad for not informing you way earlier about my situation when my other friends left. I had thought about it too! I had thought, "man, I hope Comic isn't waiting up on me," but I wasn't actually fucking executing on that thought!! Past me can be so frustrating sometimes. Or, <i>me</i>- <i>I</i> can be frustrating, sometimes. Thank you for bearing with me though. I'm trying not to make silly oversights like that, because I really do value your time! Or, more accurately, I value you, and your time as an extension of you.
			<br><br>Anywho, thank you for reading this! It's in my About Me, so I know you had to go hunting. Before I leave into the great ethos of "oh, he's offline, and will be back Friday at the latest" though, I mentioned something called "Computer Adventure Game" earlier, and you might be a bit curious about that.
			<br><br>I don't wanna give too much away, but it's a game I'm working on that is nowhere <i>near</i> complete. It's also entirely browser based. There <i>may</i> be a demo up soon, but that depends on how quickly I can get my ideas together. If nothing else though, there's at least some cool music to look at. Also, keep in mind, you're not the only friend of mine that knows about Computer Adventure Game, so the text might reference a few things you're unaware of. Not to worry though, anything that's actually going to be necessary for you to understand will be present in the game when it's done. In any case though, here's the <a href="https://spiralofants.github.io/SpiralofAnts/COMPUTER%20ADVENTURE%20GAME/manual.html">manual page</a> I have up for it. There's also this <a href="https://spiralofants.github.io/SpiralofAnts/COMPUTER%20ADVENTURE%20GAME/back-panel.html">"back panel"</a> page that has a few extra songs and some very vague threads of ideas I have for the game.
			<br><br>Actually, to be honest, you're kind of the person I'm most excited to share this with once it's complete. You're my only friend who seems to have any interest in my characters beyond what I go out of my way to tell them. So, in a way, this game is sort of a way to show my characters off to the people who care, my "audience". You. Of course, I'd <i>love</i> to get my other friends in along for the ride, but you're actually going to have experience with the characters in my game! In a very real way, this game is primarily for you. Anybody else who will also listen is <i>free</i> to do so, but they are not the audience I had in mind.
			<br><br>Don't take that as "you gotta be interested in this now" though. Because, like, I mean... I don't even know if I have to explain it, but <i>I</i> would feel a social pressure to be interested, so I feel I should clarify. I may have hyped this thing up as being made "for you," but really, it's just a good thing that it's happening. It's my firm belief that art can stand on it's own, and I really do believe this will! Like, it may have a specific audience in mind, but ideally, <i>most</i> people are going to be able to understand it. And so, despite Computer Adventure Game being "made for you," you are not a necessary part of it. I mean, you <i>were</i>, you inspired me to start work on it, but it is not necessary for you to <i>experience</i> it. Y'know?
			<br><br><br><br>Anyways, writing this has taken up a significantly longer time than I thought it would, and it's already a little after 2 AM. Kehehehe! I've gotta go to bed, but I hope you enjoyed reading this! And I hope you're satisfied in knowing you've made not only a real positive impact on this mouse's life, but also a friend for life out of said mouse. Goodnight now! Kehehehehehehehe!

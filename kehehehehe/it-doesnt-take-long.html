			Hi Comic! Again, I speak like this because conversation is not a vector I'm all too familiar with, and while being better at conversation certain does interest me, I find this format to be a lot more... honest? Like, the only thing I <i>want</i> to accomplish here is to share my thoughts. Any resulting thoughts you have, while they <i>do</i> interest me, are extraneous to my desire to share my thoughts with you to begin with. And, on that topic, I want to share these particular thoughts because we've brushed up against them recently!
			<br><br>So, without further ado, I'd like to monologue about my thoughts and feelings on our roleplaying. Because, <i>god</i> is it interesting.
			<br><br>Firstly, I want to straight up tell you what I'm getting out of our roleplays. Perhaps most obviously, Alucard - my mouse - is an author self-insert. A <i>lot</i> of my enjoyment comes through playing as him because, in a very real way, it's not so much "playing" as it is "being" for me. Talking as though I were really this silly little anthro mouse is, to me, the most fulfilling form of self expression I've ever tasted. Moreso than my music, and moreso than the sexual desires I once associated so heavily with our roleplaying. I... don't know how much sense this makes, but roleplaying as Alucard is my way of being me.
			<br><br>I know I started the last paragraph off with "firstly," but I just finished drafting several paragraphs of "secondly," and I just realized that... I haven't actually been enjoying our roleplays as a sexual thing recently. Not that that's a bad thing! I just hadn't consciously made note of it until this moment. But it does cause me to ask, "where do we go from here?" Because, hearing me just plain out tell you "the whole main thing we've been focusing on, I stopped liking it," you may think I want a change. But no, actually! The idea that someone can not only interact with an honest version of me, but <i>also</i> get sexual pleasure out of doing so at virtually <i>no</i> cost to myself other than time is actually a really cool idea to me! Kehehehehehehe!
			<br><br>Finally, then, I have reached the point where I know what I want from our relationship! And, the cherry on top, I also know I'm getting all I could reasonably want! Kehe.. Kehehe.. Kehahahahaha<i>haaa!</i> That is such a <i>liberating</i> feeling! And so, in order to share this sense of joy, I simply <i>must</i> ask, what are you getting out of our relationship? And how, dear Comic, can I help achieve that vision?
			<br><br><br><br>Of course, to make that an approachable question, I'm actually going to <i>ask</i> you at some point, not just stuff it here. 'Course, if you find the question easy enough to answer without me bringing it directly to the doorstep of your brain*, feel free! Kehehehe! Don't think I'm relying on my website to do <i>all</i> the work of being a person for me though. That question is important enough for me to ask you at some point, and so I simply <i>will</i> ask it eventually.
			<br><br>*That analogy was particularly unparsable. If you find you can answer the question without me having to ask you directly in a more... <i>generally</i> understandable way, you are encouraged to do so.
